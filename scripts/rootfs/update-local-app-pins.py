"""Fold a resolved APK closure into the local-app runtime pins, or check it.

The pins file is the single source of version truth for the on-device Alpine
toolchain, so the closure it records has to be *generated* from a real
resolution rather than hand-maintained. `--check` is the release-gate direction:
it re-runs the comparison without writing, so CI fails when a rebuild produces a
closure that differs from what is committed.
